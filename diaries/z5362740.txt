# Matt's Diary

## Week 1

14/09/23
In the first week we chose our team, as well as the project we wanted to do. This being P18, the task management platform.
We discussed the architecture that we were intending to use as well as some of our backgrounds with web development.
This mainly covered any background we may have had in using Next.js, React, and Supabase.
We also set up our Jira team.

17/09/23
I spent a little bit of time getting more familiar with Next.js in my personal time to prepare for using it in the project.

## Week 2

21/09/23
In the lab, we discussed what we had to do for the project proposal, as this would be due in little over a week.
As a team, we wrote some basic user stories for a general task platform, and then delegated what areas of the proposal we would do.
I was assigned to work on the storyboards with Luke, as we decided to use Figma to create the pages of the website, using mobile first design.
We would then use these pages to create the user flows that capture the user stories.
We also set up Github.

After the lab, we set up a time for a meeting with our client, Basem, who helped answer some questions and give ideas about how we should approach our chosen project.
Basem had suggested that he would like to see each team aim for a specialisation in the type of task manager we would produce.
This gave us some ideas about what we would like to specialise in. We had thought of a software development task manager that connects freelancers to client,
but this seemed to similar to other projects, and didn't really fit the requirement of needing bidders.

I did some brainstorming and suggested things like babysitting, house sitting or pet sitting, and Alex suggested that doing pet care tasks would be good.
We all agreed on this specialisation.

22/09/23
Luke, Alex and I got together on Discord to keep working on the proposal, and we improved the user stories for our specialisation.
Luke and I also further added more pages to our Figma design.

24/09/23
We had a team meeting to go over progress on the proposal.
Alex added the user stories to the Jira board, and assigned them all epics.
We were then assigned to add acceptance criteria to all of the user stories.

## Week 3

26/09/23
Luke and I worked some more on the Figma design, starting to create the user flows to capture important user stories.

27/09/23
Added the Figma story boards to the proposal doc, and added some more explaination to the user stories in the doc.

28/09/23
In the lab, we discussed the final parts of the proposal to finish off.
We also had our first sprint planning session where we pointed all of the user stories in Jira, and assigned the first few tickets.
We then set up Supabase and defined the first tables so that we could connect our app to the database.

29/09/23
We finished off the final part of the report in the morning, and submitted it.
Alex and I then added the initialisation code to our app so that we could access Supabase.

30/09/23
I implemented the registration flow and pages for TASK-6.

## Week 4

2/10/23
Had a team meeting to make sure everyone was able to setup and start working on development.

5/10/23
In the lab we had some discussion about progress and encouraged everyone to approve more requests, as it was mostly myself getting around to approving.

In general I was busy with other work, and was also waiting for other tickets to be completed that were blockers for me.
Everyone else was good at gettign work done, but it was quiet for me generally this week.

## Week 5

9/10/23
Worked on choosing bidder, and improved some work on the view post page to clean up some of the logic.

11/10/23
This was the day before our Demo A. I worked on improving the filtering for posts page. I also fixed some issues with the navbar.
The team met to discuss what we were doing for the demo and made some cool branding improvements for the page.

12/10/23
We had our Demo A, which went well. We showed off our progress and got some feedback.
We then as a team held the retro meeting, where we talked about the issues, and improvements we could make by reflecting on our past sprint.
This went well and we decided that things were generally really good, just needed some improvment to things like approvals and branches.

14/10/23
Since it was hard to get everyone to meet during flex week to plan the next sprint, Alex and I decided to do it for the team.
I had done some more work on general planning that the team discussed after our retro, and fleshed out a lot of the acceptance criterea of the tickets.
Alex and I just had to choose which tickets to include in our sprint, and we then assigned some of the first tickets.

## Week 6

15/10/23
I was interested in starting early for this sprint and knocked out admin invites, as well as fixing an issue with the navbar.

For the rest of the week I didn't do too much since I was incredibly busy with other course work and work.

## Week 7

24/10/23
I worked on the admin registration, which wasn't too hard since registration was very similar.
I also worked on the admin users table, which allowed admins to see and manage all the users on the platform.

26/10/23
In the lab we had a progress update with our tutor. There wasn't too much yet, since a lot of work wasn't completed due to time shortages in week 6.
We also got some more stuff approved.

## Week 8

1/11/23
We had a quick meeting to organise and run through any last minute fixes that we needed. This went mostly well and only a few bugs that weren't working.
I made a quick PR with the fixes. I also made some notes for things to fix next sprint.

2/11/23
With the notes, I realised that some of the issues were actually bugs that we had already created that weren't resolved in the sprint yet.
So I just quickly finished some of the small tickets off. This was 3 really small PRs that were quickly merged.

In the Demo B we quickly showed off our new changes and that went smoothly for the most part. Not too much feedback other than some minor visual changes.

For the retro we quickly held a meeting and discussed last sprints to try notes and reflected on how we went. We then did the rest of the retro and wrote up some basic notes.
Owen was able to help finish that off for the most part which was awesome since I was bogged with lots of other course work.

## Week 9

This week we only really started the sprint on Sunday/Monday due to limited availability to hold the grooming session.
We got the sprint together, which was mostly just a lot of improvements to our current functionality.

I assigned some tickets to myself, mainly doing work that was for visual improvements to the styling of the page.
I worked on some of these early and then finished the week with one of the bigger tickets to improve post fetching.

In our lab, we had a catchup and just showed off some simple new stuff to our tutor.

## Week 10

In the last week, I spent my time doing as much as I could on finishing up my assigned tickets.
This involved cleaning up a lot of the styling within the website.

Due to other courses having work due in this week I wasn't able to get a good headstart on the report, and had to focus on development for the demonstration.

Leading up to the final demo, we held some quick meetings to ensure everything was working and just practices going through the flow
and assigned who would show what parts, ensuring everyone presented something.

For our demo, our client Basem was present to observe our final product and ask any clarifying questions.
The demo itself went very smoothly and Basem was impressed with our final product.

In order to get the report done, I just had to do some work on the introduction and overview, as well as some implementation challenges I faced
and the installation manual.

Submitting our final work was very satisfying and I am proud of our teams contributions to finish the task without much stress.
